circuit_evolution(measurements::Array{Complex{Float64},1},frequencies::Array{Float64,1}; <keyword arguments>)

Identify an equivalent electrical circuit that fits a given set of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. 

The inputs are a circuit (e.g. "R1-[C2,R3]-P4") an array of complex-valued impedance measurements and their corresponding
frequencies. The output is a EquivalentCircuit object containing a field Circuit, which is a string denoting the identified circuit
and a field Parameters, which is a NamedTuple of the circuit's components with their corresponding parameter values.

# Arguments
- `generations::Integer=10`: the maximum number of iterations of the evolutionary algorithm.
- `population_size::Integer=30`: the number of individuals in the population during each iteration.
- `terminals::String="RCLP"`: the circuit components that are to be included in the circuit identification.
- `head::Integer=8`: a hyperparameter than controls the maximum considered complexity of the circuits.
- `cutoff::Float64=0.8`: a hyperparameter that controls the circuit complexity by removing redundant components.
- `initial_population::Array{Circuit,1}=nothing`:the option to provide an initial population of circuits
(obtained by using the loadpopulation function) with which the algorithm starts.
